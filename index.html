   This page is the former unofficial webpage for Unity's Advanced Graphics Research team based in Grenoble.
   This team does not exist anymore, but most of its members started a <a href="https://ggx-research.github.io/">new journey together</a>.
   <br /><br />
   We keep the publications and demos list for conservation purpose.
