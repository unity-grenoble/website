Use this tool to turn an existing, non-tileable stochastic texture into a tileable texture, by manipulating its edges using <a href="https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/722-2/">histogram-preserving blending</a>. It works on all random-phase inputs, as well as on many non-random-phase inputs which are stochastic and non-periodic, typically natural textures such as moss, granite, sand, bark, etc.
