We study the links between microfacet and microflake theories from the perspective of linear transport theory. In doing so,we gain additional insights, find several simplifications and touch upon important open questions as well as possible pathsforward in extending the unification of surface and volume scattering models. First, we introduce a semi-infinite homogeneousexponential-free-path medium that (a) produces exactly the same light transport as the Smith microsurface scattering modeland the inhomogeneous Smith medium that was recently introduced by Heitz et al, and (b) allows us to rederive all the Smithmasking and shadowing functions in a simple way. Second, we investigate in detail what new aspects of linear transport theoryenable  a  volume  to  act  like  a  rough  surface.  We  show  that  this  is  mostly  due  to  the  use  of  non-symmetric  distributions  ofnormals and explore how the violation of this symmetry impacts light transport within the microflake volume without breakingglobal reciprocity. Finally, we argue that the surface profiles that would be consistent with very rough Smith microsurfaceshave geometrically implausible shapes. To overcome this, we discuss an extension of Smith theory in the volume setting thatincludes NDFs on the entire sphere in order to produce a single unified reflectance model capable of describing everything froma smooth flat mirror all the way to a semi-infinite isotropically scattering medium with both low and high roughness regimes inbetween.
