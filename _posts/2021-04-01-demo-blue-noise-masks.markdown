This github repository provides a generator for dither masks with blue-noise power spectrums. The generator is based on the algorithm introduced in the 1993 paper "Void-and-cluster method for dither array generation", by Ulichney. The generated masks are tileable and can have arbitrary resolutions. The generator runs on the GPU and recquires an OpenGL4.5 compatible card.
