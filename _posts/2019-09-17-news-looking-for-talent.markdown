Unity Technologies wishes to grow its Unity Labs Grenoble team, located in Montbonnot Saint-Martin, France.
There are multiple openings both in engineering and research and with various types of positions:
* masters or PhD internships (5 months minimal),
* engineers (junior or senior),
* candidates for a PhD, and 
* junior or senior researchers.

We are looking for talented people willing to undertake research (with possibility and even incentive to publish in top-tier academic journals and venues) or engineering in the field of Computer Graphics.

Our current team is concentrated around photorealistic rendering (eg, material modelling, sampling, procedural texturing) and deep-learning for rendering (eg, denoising, style transfer, texture synthesis): please see our publication list for more details. We wish to welcome young researchers and engineers in those fields and/or more experienced researchers in related ones: in particular graphical content creation (3D reconstruction and animation, textures, materials) through machine learning.  Experienced researchers will be encouraged to pursue their own research. For less experienced candidates (pre-PhD) and engineers, we can offer several subjects related to our fields of expertise.


##### Who can apply ?
Highly-motivated junior or senior engineers and (possibly aspiring) researchers with experience (or at least a master-level diploma, or about to complete one) in the fields of Computer Graphics and/or Deep Learning.

##### How to apply ?
Please send us an e-mail with a CV, portfolio and/or publication record to get in touch and weâ€™ll get back to you quickly.
